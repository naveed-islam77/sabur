        <h3>What Is Bankruptcy?</h3>

        <p>
          Bankruptcy is a tool for debt relief. There are six different types of
          bankruptcies under United States bankruptcy law. Each serves either an
          individual or an entity like a business or local government. Chapter 7
          and Chapter 13 are personal bankruptcies that serve individuals who
          have a lot of medical, credit card, or other consumer debt. Chapters
          9, 11, 12, and 15 are bankruptcies that serve business entities that
          need to reorganize or restructure their debt.
        </p>
        <p>
          The bankruptcy types are called “chapters” because each one is named
          after a section called a chapter of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. This is
          the federal law that governs bankruptcy cases. Because the bankruptcy
          court is a federal court and bankruptcy laws are federal, the
          bankruptcy process looks similar from state to state.
        </p>

        <h3>The Six Bankruptcy Types, Explained</h3>

        <p>
          Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 bankruptcy are two of the most common types
          of bankruptcy filings. But there are four other types — Chapters 9,
          11, 12, and 15. Here is a breakdown of the six different types of
          bankruptcy filings, starting with the most common.{" "}
        </p>

        <h4>Chapter 7 Bankruptcy</h4>
        <p>
          People who are struggling with credit card debt, medical bills, or
          other debt that they can&apos;t get out from under most commonly file
          Chapter 7. This often provides the quickest path to a financial fresh
          start. To be eligible for Chapter 7, you have to show the bankruptcy
          court that you don&apos;t make enough to pay even a portion of your
          debts. You show this by taking what is called a Means Test.
        </p>

        <h4>How Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Works</h4>
        <p>
          Chapter 7 is called a “liquidation bankruptcy” because if you own
          property that is not protected by exemptions, you must liquidate
          (sell) it to pay toward your debts. While this probably sounds scary,
          according to the American Bankruptcy Institute, upwards of 96% of
          Chapter 7 filers get to keep all their belongings. This is because
          many assets are protected by exemptions.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Most personal Chapter 7 bankruptcy cases last 4–6 months. Filers often
          get their bankruptcy discharge (the court order that eliminates your
          dischargeable debt) about 3–4 months after they file. Chapter 7
          bankruptcy can stay on your credit report for up to 10 years, but many
          filers see a noticeable increase in their credit score within two
          years of filing their case. Keep in mind, you can start rebuilding
          your credit as soon as you get your discharge.
        </p>

        <h3>Chapter 13 Bankruptcy</h3>
        <p>
          This is the second most common type of personal bankruptcy. Unlike
          Chapter 7 filings, businesses (other than sole proprietors, usually
          small business owners) are not allowed to file Chapter 13 bankruptcy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chapter 13 bankruptcy is more complicated than Chapter 7 and lasts
          much longer due to the required repayment plan. Chapter 13 helps you
          reorganize your debts. It puts you on a 3–5 year repayment plan. At
          the end of the repayment period, any remaining unsecured debt is
          discharged. To file Chapter 13, your secured debt and your unsecured
          debt (including personal loans) can&apos;t exceed a certain amount.
          The filing will stay on your credit report for seven years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why would someone choose Chapter 13 over Chapter 7? One of the most
          common reasons is that they want to prevent their home from being
          foreclosed. Someone might also choose Chapter 13 over Chapter 7 if
          they make too much money to file Chapter 7.
        </p>

        <h3>How Chapter 13 Bankruptcy Works</h3>
        <p>
          You create a budget based on your monthly income and living expenses
          and tell the bankruptcy court how much you can afford to pay each
          month. The court and the bankruptcy trustee review your proposed
          reorganization plan.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Once it&apos;s approved by the court, all you have to do is pay your
          disposable income to the trustee, and send in your tax return every
          year. Your remaining debt (other than student loans) is wiped out once
          this is done.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some people file Chapter 13 bankruptcy because they make too much
          money to qualify for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Others choose to file
          Chapter 13 because it gives them a certain benefit they&apos;re not
          able to get in Chapter 7. You can, for example, avoid the sale of
          nonexempt assets by filing Chapter 13.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Filing Chapter 13 also gives you the chance to pay back certain
          nondischargeable debts, like past due alimony or child support and pay
          off car loans with a lower interest rate. You can do it all in
          manageable monthly payments based on your regular income.{" "}
        </p>

        <h3>Chapter 9 Bankruptcy</h3>
        <p>
          Chapter 9 bankruptcy allows municipalities (including cities, towns,
          and villages), counties, taxing districts, municipal utilities, and
          school districts to restructure their financial obligations.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Much like the wage earner&apos;s plan under Chapter 13 or the Chapter
          11 plan of reorganization, a bankruptcy proceeding under Chapter 9
          allows the filer to propose a repayment plan to deal with its
          obligations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since Chapter 9 does not cover states or territories outside of the
          United States, Congress had to pass the 2016 Puerto Rico Oversight,
          Management, and Economic Stability Act to allow the U.S. territory
          access to bankruptcy protection.
        </p>

        <h3>Chapter 11 Bankruptcy</h3>
        <p>
          Businesses, individuals, or married couples can file Chapter 11. But
          this chapter isn&apos;t typically included in the list of personal
          bankruptcy options because the court filing fee alone is more than
          $1,700 and bankruptcy attorney fees usually start somewhere around
          $15,000.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Filing Chapter 11 as an individual usually only makes sense if
          you&apos;re a very high earner or business owner who can&apos;t file a
          Chapter 13 bankruptcy because you have too much debt.{" "}
        </p>
        <h4>Business Bankruptcy: Chapter 7 vs. Chapter 11</h4>

        <p>
          Business bankruptcy refers to bankruptcy cases that are filed for
          businesses to get out of debt. Businesses can file either Chapter 7 or
          Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Almost 91% of all the Chapter 11 bankruptcies
          filed in 2022, were filed by businesses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chapter 11 can be used to restructure the business and its financial
          obligations. The bankruptcy protections granted by the automatic stay
          give the business an opportunity to propose a payment plan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Businesses who file Chapter 7 bankruptcy are usually in the process of
          shutting down. All of the business assets (from real estate to
          personal property) are sold and unsecured creditors are paid in order
          of priority. It&apos;s important to note that businesses do not get to
          claim exemptions.
        </p>

        <h3>Chapter 12 Bankruptcy</h3>
        <p>
          Chapter 12 bankruptcy gives family farmers and those operating a
          commercial fishing operation the ability to reorganize their debt
          without having to go through the expensive Chapter 11 bankruptcy
          process.
        </p>
        <p>
          It works similar to a Chapter 13, but includes specific provisions to
          deal with the unique nature of family farming and family fishermen
          operations. Once the Chapter 12 repayment plan is completed, the filer
          receives a bankruptcy discharge.
        </p>

        <h3>Chapter 15 Bankruptcy</h3>
        <p>
          Chapter 15 bankruptcy comes into play when an individual (or business)
          files a bankruptcy case under the bankruptcy laws of another country
          but has assets or liabilities in the United States. Its purpose is to
          provide an effective way for dealing with cases that involve
          cross-border issues and to ensure cooperation between foreign and U.S.
          bankruptcy courts.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          The U.S. Bankruptcy Code outlines several types of bankruptcies. Your
          financial situation typically determines what chapter of bankruptcy
          best meets your goals.{" "}
