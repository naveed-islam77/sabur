          Imagine your current investments in your brokerage accounts, IRA, 401k

          can stuff into those pre-tax strategies.

        <p>
          <b>The Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA)</b>
          materially changed the landscape of qualified plan design. It is
          unquestionably the best piece of retirement planning legislation for
          business owners in decades from a contributory, regulatory and
          fiduciary perspective.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>The Private 401(k) Plan™ Design</b>
          combines the most current qualified plan law under PPA 2006, with
          customized plan documentation; advanced, conservative, actuarial
          methods and the comprehensive benefits of multiple plan forms.
          Contributions and corresponding tax deductions for owners,
          professionals and other highly compensated participants can average
          between three to twenty times the stand alone PS 401(k) limit of
          $58,000 to $64,500 for 2021. Just as importantly the percentage of the
          plan contribution for owners can often exceed 90%+ of the total.
        </p>
        <b>
          The 2021 PS 401k limit = $58,000 to $64,500 ($19,500 = 401k plus,
          $6,500 catch-up provision for participants 50+) and the Social
          Security Wage Base expands to $142,800.
        </b>
        <b>
          Conversely, a Private 401(k) Plan™ design that only spends $58,000 to
          $64,500 for each owner will normally experience a material reduction
          in overall employee participant costs.
        </b>
        <b>
          Add the security of a pension to the fact that the owner has total
          control of the pension trust and a much, much lower fiduciary risk
          profile and PPA is a huge winner.{" "}
        </b>
        <p>
          In light of the recent LaRue decision by the Supreme Court, fiduciary
          issues cannot be over emphasized. The Private 401(k) add-on plan
          contributions (defined benefits) are fiduciary friendly. The LaRue
          decision was only 401(k) directed. In a litigious environment what
          more needs to be said.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Private 401(k) Plan™</b>
          annual plan contributions for key employees (company owners) routinely
          reach $250,000 to $500,000+, and under the right set of facts and
          circumstances can exceed $1 million. Due to current interest rates (30
          year treasuries in the 3% range) plans using guaranteed interest and
          annuity rates (412(e)(3) plans), no longer have much, if any,
          contribution advantage.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>The Private 401(k) Plan™</b>
          will give a client a 6% to 25% profit sharing contribution (with or
          without a safe harbor) in addition to a full elective 401k deferral
          plus a full Private 401(k) add-on in the form of either a cash
          balance, traditional or fully guaranteed pension benefit.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Since 2006, a Private 401(k) Plan™</b>
          covered by the PBGC can utilize up to a 25% profit sharing plus a full
          elective k deferral in addition to the Private K add-on. PPA 2006 is
          quite simply business owner friendly pension legislation.

            Authority
          </b>
          was effectively given in IRS Notice 2007-28: Clarification on
          Deduction Limits for Combination DB/DC Plans, the highlights of which
          are as follows:
        </p>

        <h4>Limits for Combination DB/DC Plans</h4>
        <p>
          The
          <b> Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA)</b>
          provided changes to the rules governing the deduction limits for
          certain qualified plan arrangements under IRC §404(a)(7) where the
          plan sponsor makes contributions to both a defined benefit and defined
          contribution for the same group of participants in a particular year.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b> Since the enactment of PPA,</b>
          here has been considerable debate on the interpretation of these rules
          among pension practitioners and regulators and this has led to a
          number of issues. In response to this ongoing debate, the IRS released
          Notice 2007-28 (https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-07-28.pdf)
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Prior to the enactment of PPA, IRC §404(a)(7)</b>
          provided that in the event of contributions to a combination of 1 or
          more DC plans and one or more DB plans, the total amount deductible in
          a taxable year under such plans could not exceed the greater of:
        </p>
        <p>
          25% of the compensation paid or accrued during the taxable year to the
          beneficiaries under such plans, or
        </p>
        <p>
          The amount of contributions made to or under the DB plans to the
          extent that such contributions do not exceed the amount necessary to
          satisfy the minimum funding standard provided by IRC
        </p>
        <p>
          §412 with respect to any such DB plan for the plan year that ends with
          or within such taxable year.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>PPA §803 amended IRC §404(a)(7)</b>
          to apply the combined plan limits only in the case of employer
          contributions to one or more DC plans to the extent that such
          contributions exceed 6% of the compensation otherwise paid or accrued
          during the taxable year to the beneficiaries under the plan. (Note:
          25% of compensation for ERISA plans beginning in 2008.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Pension practitioners assumed that with the “6% cushion” enacted by
          PPA, plan sponsors could fund DC matching and nonelective
          contributions up to 6% of aggregate compensation of the DC plan
          participants without triggering the IRC §404(a)(7) limit. If employer
          contributions to the DC plan exceeded 6%, it was generally assumed
          that only the DC contribution in excess of 6% would be counted toward
          the combined limit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some practitioners though were concerned that if the DC contributions
          exceeded the 6%, the IRS would interpret the law to include all DC
          contributions in the 25% limit, including those in excess of 6%. This
          would effectively mean that a DC contribution of “one penny more”
          would eliminate the ability to deduct not only the penny but the
          entire 6% which would have been otherwise deductible had the extra
          penny not been contributed.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Q&A-8</b>
          clarifies that the “all or nothing, based on just one penny more”
          interpretation does not apply to situations where employer
          contributions to DC plans exceed 6% of the applicable compensation.
          The general rule of IRC §404(a)(7) for determining the maximum amount
          deductible remains the same, but the employer contributions to which
          the rule applies are equal to the employer contributions in excess of
          6% of applicable participant&apos;s compensation in the DC plan.

          as charitable giving intentions without the otherwise 50% of AGI
          limitation. Plan contributions and corresponding tax deductions can be
          utilized to establish contra-accounts i.e. tax/cash reserves that may
          be utilized by savvy employers to selectively enhance the future
          values of a comprehensive benefit package.

            Between 1995 and 2020 the IRC §415(b)(1)(A) limits{" "}
          </b>{" "}
          have increased from $120,000 to $230,000 with increases of $5,000 to
          $20,000 in 16 of the last 20 years. In conjunction with a plan’s 50%
          cushion these life insurance premiums can provide a cost effective
          method of prefunding COLAs before they are announced.

          <b>Private 401k Plan™ Summary </b>A properly designed Private 401k
          Plan™ then can include a fully funded and fully deductible cash
          balance, traditional or any other form of pension; a fully funded and

        <h4>Evolution of the Private 401(k) Plan™ Design</h4>
        <p>
          The one thing the benefits industry is not is static. The Private 401k
          Plan™ Design retains its basic combined plan features: a cross tested
          Profit Sharing 401k Plan and a Pension Plan, while at the same time
          refining the pension characteristics of the cash balance form of
          pension to a targeted plan using a concurrent offset. The final
          evolution of the plans Aggregated Benefits, as defined by the
          IRS&apos;s Isaacs and Marshall, to a benefit choice on an individual
          participant basis of either a stand-alone or combination
          post-retirement medical expense reimbursement or life insurance
          benefit.{" "}

        <b>The “Cushion”</b>
        <p>
          The contribution maximum’s can be increased by a formula that will add
          an estimated 25% to 50% of the otherwise maximum contribution
          accelerating the maximum accumulation of funds in the shortest period
          of time.

        <b>The “Double-Up”</b>
        <p>
          Private 401K Plan™ Contributions can be doubled in the 1st tax year.
          See IRC §404(a)(6); plan year contributions subsequent to the
          Double-up will be approximately 60% of the Double-up.
