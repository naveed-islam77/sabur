          location agreed to by the parties. Arbitration shall be initiated by
          filing a statement of claim with JAMS Inc. Any award the arbitrator
          makes will be final, and judgment on it may be entered in any court
          having jurisdiction. This arbitration agreement shall be enforced and
          interpreted exclusively in accordance with applicable federal law,
          including the Federal Arbitration Act. Any costs, fees or taxes
          involved in enforcing the award shall be fully assessed against and
          paid by the party resisting enforcement of said award. No person shall
          bring a putative or certified class action to arbitration, nor seek to
          enforce any pre-dispute arbitration agreement against any person who
          has initiated in court a putative class action who is a member of a
          putative class who has not opted out of the class with respect to any
          claims encompassed by the putative class action until the class
          certification is denied, the class is decertified, or the customer is
          excluded from the class by the court. Such forbearance to enforce an
          agreement to arbitrate shall not constitute a waiver of any rights
          under these Terms of Use except to the extent stated herein.
