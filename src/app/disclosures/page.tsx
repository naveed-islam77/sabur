        <p className="font-bold mt-6">Rankings and Awards:</p>
        <p className="mt-6 font-light">
          Third-party rankings, awards listings and/or recognition by
          unaffiliated third-party rating services and/or publications should
          not be construed by a client or prospective client as a guarantee that
          he/she will experience a certain level of results if Advisor is
          engaged, or continues to be engaged, to provide investment advisory
          services, nor should it be construed as a current or past endorsement
          of Advisor by any of its clients. Third-party rankings and recognition
          from rating services and publications do not guarantee future
          investment success. Working with a highly rated investment advisor
          also does not ensure that a client or prospective client will
          experience a higher level of performance. Generally, but not always,
          ratings, rankings and recognition are based on information provided by
          Advisor to be considered for the award and does not pay an application
          fee to participate.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-6 font-light">
          Rankings are provided for informational purposes only and should not
          be used as the sole basis for engaging Advisor for advisory services.
          Please refer to the more thorough disclosure and additional
          information about the criteria used in making these rankings via the
          website of the publication and/or organization granting such
          recognition.
